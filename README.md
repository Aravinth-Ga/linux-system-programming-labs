# Linux System Programming Labs

This repository contains hands-on lab exercises created while studying
**Linux System Programming** by Robert Love.

The goal is to build deep, long-lasting understanding of Linux system calls
by isolating concepts and experimenting with kernel behavior.

## Philosophy

- One concept per lab
- Minimal code, maximum clarity
- Focus on *why* something works or fails
- Learn by observing kernel behavior, not memorizing APIs

## Current Progress

- Chapter 2 – File I/O
  - File opening (`open()` and `close()`) – in progress

## Environment

- Language: C
- Platform: Linux (tested on modern distributions)
- Focus: User-space system programming, POSIX interfaces

## Notes

This repository intentionally avoids large frameworks or abstractions.
Each lab is designed to be read, compiled, and understood in isolation.
