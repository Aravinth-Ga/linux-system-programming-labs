Small exercises around `write()`. Simple ones cover basics and flags;
advanced ones explore append vs offsets, partial writes, and durability.

Simple

- `lab02_write_with_open_flags.c`
- `lab03_write_append_vs_offset.c`

Advanced
- `lab04_writeall_and_partial.c`
- `lab05_write_durability_fsync_fdatasync.c`
