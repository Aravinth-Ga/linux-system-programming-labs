# Regular Files

Regular files are the baseline. I keep the first set of labs here to get the
feel of open/read/write and related behavior.

Simple vs advanced
- Simple: straight-line examples
- Advanced: loops, offsets, or extra checks

Done
- open() flags and errors (7 labs)
- read() basics and return values (5 labs)
- write() basics with flags, append, and durability (5 labs)
- lseek() positioning and error cases (4 labs)

Next
- stat() and file metadata
- permissions and file modes
- directories and directory operations
- links (hard and symbolic)
