# Regular Files

Regular files are the baseline. I keep the first set of labs here to get the
feel of open/read/write and related behavior.

Simple vs advanced
- Simple: straight-line examples
- Advanced: loops, offsets, or extra checks

Done
- open() flags and errors
- read() basics and return values

Next
- write(), lseek(), stat()
- permissions and directories
